Build Litevirt Hypervisor LiveCD based on CentOS 6.4

1. Install a host with CentOS 6.4

2. Clone litevirt-livecd git repository

3. Have livecd-tools installed on the host, which does not exist on CentOS 
   repo. Please follow this link: 
   https://projects.centos.org/trac/livecd/wiki/GetToolset

4. Have appliance-tools-minimizer installed on the host, which does not 
   exist on CentOS repo either but can be rebuilt from F18 version.

5. Create a local repo that contains appliance-tools-minimizer.
   $ createrepo /root/repo/RPMS

6. Add this repo to litevirt-livecd.ks

7. Create the livecd:
   $ ./litevirt-creator -c spins/cos64/litevirt-livecd.ks
